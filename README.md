# MRC_all-Shiny
Shiny App for MRC All

Tasks to complete

1. Expand App for input of five variables. The MRC_all_shiny.R file calculates for 5 variables. The file app.R needs to be updated

2. (Bigger) Smooth out the interface so it isn't so clunky. 

A great example of what we might try to look like is here: 

shiny::runGitHub("mc_power_med", "schoam4")
